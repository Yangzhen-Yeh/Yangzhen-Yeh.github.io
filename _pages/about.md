Hi there. My name is Ye, Yangzhen. You can call me **Yangzhen** or **Michael** 

I graduated from [**Soochow University**](http://eng.suda.edu.cn/) in June 2024 with degrees in Management Science and Education. Currently pursuing a Master's degree with a focus on _Student Access and Success_ in **Higher Education** at the [**Marsal Family School of Education**](https://marsal.umich.edu/) at the [**University of Michigan, Ann Arbor**](https://umich.edu/). Also, I am working as a Program Assistant at the [**Digital Studies Institute**](https://www.digitalstudies.umich.edu/)ï½œ[**College of LSA**](https://lsa.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan. 

I am interested in research related to **Higher Education** and **Education management**, with a particular interest in the topics of **educational equity**, **student success**, **low-income families**, **low socioeconomic status (SES) families**, **quantitive research** and **first-generation college students**.

# Research Interests & Current Projects

## ðŸŽ¯ Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **educational equity**, **student success**, and the **philosophy and organization of higher education**. He is particularly interested in:

- The experiences of **first-generation college students**
- **Class-based inequality** in higher education access, success, and outcomes
- How **student-faculty interactions** impact learning and persistence
- The role of **intergroup dynamics** and **institutional climate** in shaping studentsâ€™ sense of belonging
- Applications of **quantitative methods** in education research, including regression analysis and large-scale dataset studies

My work aims to bridge **macro-level structural analysis** with **micro-level student experiences**, in order to uncover the mechanisms through which inequality is reproducedâ€”and more importantly, how it can be disrupted.

## ðŸ”¬ Current Research Projects

### 1. *How Student-Initiated Faculty Interactions Shape Academic Success*  
**Dataset:** Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS:2002)  
**Methods:** OLS Regression, Quantitative Analysis in Stata  
This independent project explores how informal interactions initiated by students affect academic outcomes such as GPA and persistence. The study also examines variation across different student groups, including first-generation and low-income students.

### 2. *Class Bias in Predictive Metrics of Student Success* (In Development)  
**Dataset:** High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09)  
**Focus:** Investigating the class-based bias embedded in widely-used metrics (e.g., GPA, test scores) that are used to predict student performance and allocate institutional support.  
This project aims to highlight systemic inequities in educational assessment and propose more equitable alternatives.

### 3. *Qualitative Evaluation of Open-Access Math Textbook Development*  
**Project:** PROTEUS Project  
**Lab:** RTMUS Lab (PI: Dr. Vilma Mesa)  
**Role:** Graduate Research Assistant  
Using qualitative coding and thematic analysis, this project evaluates the development and pedagogical design process of open-source online mathematics textbooks. The work contributes to improving accessible and inclusive STEM education resources.

---

### 4. *Measuring Intergroup Learning and Belonging in Higher Education*  
**Partner:** Intergroup Relations (IGR), University of Michigan  
**Timeline:** Summer 2025  
**Methods:** Descriptive Visualization, Survey Data Analysis  
This project involves analyzing the Common Assessment of Learning administered to IGR course participants, focusing on outcomes related to identity awareness, intergroup understanding, and studentsâ€™ sense of belonging. It contributes to institutional evaluation and improvement of diversity education.
