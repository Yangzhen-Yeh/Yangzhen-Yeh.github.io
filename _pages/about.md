Hi there. My name is Ye, Yangzhen. You can call me **Yangzhen** or **Michael** 

I am from Suzhou, China🇨🇳, and now I'm in Ann Arbor, United States🇺🇸.

I graduated from [**Soochow University**](http://eng.suda.edu.cn/) in June 2024 with a degree in Management Science and Education. Currently pursuing a Master's degree with a focus on _Student Access and Success_ in **Higher Education** at the [**Marsal Family School of Education**](https://marsal.umich.edu/) at the [**University of Michigan, Ann Arbor**](https://umich.edu/). Also, I am working as a Program Assistant at the [**Digital Studies Institute**](https://www.digitalstudies.umich.edu/)｜[**College of LSA**](https://lsa.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan. 

I am interested in research related to **Higher Education** and **Education management**, with a particular interest in the topics of **educational equity**, **student success**, **low-income families**, **low socioeconomic status (SES) families**, **quantitive research** and **first-generation college students**.

# _Why I am here?_
---

Personal Journey as a First-Generation Student 
------
> As a first-generation college student hailing from a low-socioeconomic background, everything within the university milieu was nearly alien to me. Despite having diligently pursued academic excellence and bearing my parents’ aspirations, stepping into university invoked not freedom and confidence but pervasive anxiety and fear. The campus felt overwhelmingly large, complex, and resource-rich. The bombardment of information made me feel disoriented.
>
> While peers were engaging with professors on research endeavors, I found the concept of research itself unfamiliar. As they skillfully navigated course selection, I was still puzzled by the categorization of required and elective courses. Thus began my struggle and avoidance, often plunging into distress and confusion. My initial thought upon entering university was, **“I don’t belong here.”** 

Exploring Educational Inequities
------
> In 2021, an interview highlighting the stark preparedness gap between first-generation students and their more privileged peers caught my attention, sparking critical questions about higher education's role in leveling the playing field. These concerns, echoing my own experiences, are central to the challenges faced by first-generation students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  To gain a deeper understanding, I pursued a multifaceted approach: minoring in education, participating in international exchange programs, and engaging in various educational practices, including teaching in rural areas.
>
> These experiences broadened my perspective on the complex realities of higher education, revealing a universal pattern: first-generation students often enter university with high aspirations but encounter unexpected obstacles. My time teaching in a rural setting was particularly enlightening, exposing me to the profound educational disparities resulting from unequal resource distribution. This experience underscored the intricate challenges faced by first-generation students, who must navigate the complexities of higher education without the advantages enjoyed by their more privileged peers. It became apparent that higher education, despite its promise of equity, can sometimes reinforce rather than dismantle social stratification.
>
> Despite the promise of equity in mass higher education, our efforts to ensure success for all students have fallen short. This realization strengthened my commitment to addressing these issues, leading me to enroll in the Master's program in Higher Education at the University of Michigan, renowned for its Center for the Study of Higher and Postsecondary Education (CSHPE). The program's focus on Diversity and Social Justice aligns perfectly with my research interests. My goal is to leverage these world-class resources, along with my personal experiences and the mentorship of esteemed faculty, to develop innovative strategies that help first-generation students overcome barriers. Ultimately, I aim to contribute to a more equitable educational landscape, both through my research at the University of Michigan and in my future career in higher education.

Previous Research on Familial Background and Academic Engagement
------
> In 2023, I conducted a quantitative research project at a Chinese university exploring the relationship between familial background and students’ academic engagement. Surveying over 100 students, we uncovered a significant positive correlation between subjective familial background (measured by parental guidance, financial support, and social connections) and academic engagement.
>
> The results highlighted the profound impact of socio-economic status and parents' educational background on students' university experiences. Students from elite backgrounds, familiar with the necessary “cultural capital,” navigated academic environments more easily than first-generation students. This study demonstrated that familial socio-economic status and first-generation status significantly influence academic engagement and overall success in higher education.
>
> These findings underscore the need for targeted support systems, policy changes, and broader societal recognition of the challenges faced by first-generation and socioeconomically disadvantaged students. To create a more equitable educational landscape, we must continue rigorous research, engage in meaningful dialogue, and implement evidence-based strategies to support all students.

Future Aspirations and Commitment to Educational Equity
------
> I am resolutely committed to addressing the critical issues facing first-generation college students from low socioeconomic backgrounds through rigorous academic research. This mission is not just a professional pursuit, but a deeply personal calling. Having once stood in their shoes, bewildered and lost, I am driven by an unwavering determination to illuminate the path for others as others have done for me. My journey is a testament to the transformative power of support and encouragement, and I am resolute in my desire to pay this forward through dedicated scholarship and advocacy.
>
> My commitment to innovation in education and the pursuit of equity is the cornerstone of this ambition. Drawing from a rich tapestry of experiences—from high school internships to grassroots work in rural schools and community service—I have gained invaluable insights into the multifaceted challenges and aspirations of students. This diverse background, coupled with my involvement in university organizations, has equipped me with a unique perspective to drive meaningful change.
>
> I stand poised at the threshold of this academic journey, brimming with passion and ready to channel my experiences, knowledge, and unwavering dedication into pioneering higher education reforms. Together, we can forge a more equitable and empowering educational landscape for all students, regardless of their background.
